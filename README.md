 #  👋 Hey, I'm byeoon 
 Hi, I don't know how to introduce myself.
 I like to develop programs and software that can impact people for the better. 
 I also like to create whatever my mind feels like creating, which can range from 
 being useless to being beneficial for even the smallest community niches.

 Software development is my passion™
